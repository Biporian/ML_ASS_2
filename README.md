Newly Generated Features:
1. Run './image_flat/flattened_images_test.ipynb' and './image_flat/flattened_images.ipynb' (this will generate a large number of image files in directory)
2. Run './dig_feature/ocr_digit_detection_test.ipynb' and './dig_feature/ocr_digit_detection.ipynb'
3. Run './CNN_feature/cnn_feature_test.ipynb' and './CNN_feature/cnn_feature.ipynb'

Run Neural Network Model:
1. Run './NN/neuralcnn.ipynb'
2. This will generate a csv called './NN/resultscnn.csv' - this is the desired Kaggle results file
